# Personal Daily Status Interview and Report

## Background

These are personal status, I will talk about one event from yesterday, then do a image

## Process

1. Identify the main event. Use meaningful headings (single focus or multiple teams as appropriate).
2. For each, answer:
    - What did you do?
    - What surprised you?
    - What went well?
    - What progress was made?
    - What challenges or pain points emerged?
3. Distill the key points and big-picture value. Review and confirm.
4. Draft and refine each section iteratively.
5. Add an unsubscribe note and image placeholder if distributing by email. Use the format `# Daily Status - [Weekday] - yyyy-mm-dd` for the title.
6. Draft the image prompt:
    - Suggest 5 possible titles
    - Suggest 10 possible styles.
    - User selects, then write the prompt.
    - Save as `yyyy-mm-dd.image_prompt.md`.

- Be brief and focused. It's fine to have just one main section if that's the day's reality.
- Use actual team names or collaboration topics for section headings.
- Encourage rapid, iterative edits and confirmation.

## Image Prompt Guidelines

1. Suggest 5 possible titles (2-4 words each).
2. Suggest 10 possible image styles.
3. Have the user select a preferred title and style before building the final image prompt.
4. Build the prompt.

## Style Guidelines

- Short and concise. 1-2 paragraphs per team/section.
- Easy to read and scan; email should be readable in under 5 minutes.
- Start new sentences on new lines, so the markdown does not need to wrap.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key insights, and bold for emphasis where appropriate.
- Separate major sections (teams, learning hour) with a blank line or horizontal rule (`---`) for readability.
- Start each team/section with "Today, I...", "Today, we...", or "Today, the team..." for parallel structure and natural language.
- Use actual team names in section headings (e.g., "## Team 1: Specific Team Name") for clarity.
- Include personal observations or quotes where relevant (e.g., "As I often say, 'Dissatisfaction is the service I provide.'").
- Add a "Bonus" or "Possible Opportunities" sub-section if relevant.


## File Management and Naming

- A concise short title (1-2 words) is needed for file names (e.g., "BudapestFair"). If the initial event description is long, suggest 1-2 word alternatives.
- Daily status file: `yyyy-mm-dd.<shorttitle>.md`
- Image prompt file: `yyyy-mm-dd.<shorttitle>.image_prompt.md`
- When creating the `yyyy-mm-dd.<shorttitle>.md` file, include a placeholder for the daily image: `![image](./images/yyyy-mm-dd.<shorttitle>.image.png)`
